# Multiplayer Pong
This is a simple C++ pong game I made 6 years ago with the [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)  library only. It allows two player to play together from two different computers.

The main goal was my personal experience and not the game itself.

## Description 
This project is composed of two programs: the client and the server.
First, both clients have to enter the IP address of the server, then they are able to choose the colors of their rackets in the server console before the game starts.
Each player can control their racket using their keyboard.

This project was made for me to discover multi-threading, 2D graphics and network (here using TCP / UDP protocols on a client / server architecture).
